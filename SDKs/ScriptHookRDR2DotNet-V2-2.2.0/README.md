## ScriptHookRDR2DotNet V2

An improved version of Saltyq's ScriptHookRDR2DotNet implementation.

## About

This is an *ASI plugin for Red Dead Redemption 2*, ported from [**ScriptHookVDotNet**](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/), based on the C++ ScriptHook by Alexander Blade, which allows running scripts written in any .NET language in-game.

The issues page should be primarily used for bug reports and enhancement ideas. Questions related to RDR2 scripting in general are better off in forums dedicated to this purpose, like [nexusmods.com](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2),  [gtaforums.com](https://gtaforums.com/forum/459-modding/), or [rdr2mods.com](https://www.rdr2mods.com/)

All credits go to [Saltyq](https://github.com/Saltyq) for the [original ScriptHookRDR2DotNet](https://github.com/Saltyq/ScriptHookRDR2DotNet) implementation.
